This a project that integrates the APIs of various social media applications and allows you to post content on those applications.

You can simultaneously post to twitter and telegram channels at once by running this code. The Threads app api will be integrated as soon as it is officially released.

The content has to be written in a the file with the given name, and the it has to be kept in the same folder as the .py code file. This will enable the program to read the contents of the file, process it for aesthetics and readability and post it on social media platforms like twitter/x and Telegram channels.


# Setting up API Keys
1. Copy `apikeys_template.py` and save it as `apikeys.py`.
2. Replace the placeholder values in `apikeys.py` with your actual API keys.
3. Ensure that `apikeys.py` is not committed to the repository (it is listed in the .gitignore file).
