This a project that integrates the APIs of various social media applications and allows you to post content on those applications, all from a single file.

The content has to be written in a the file with the given name, and the it has to be kept in the same folder as the .py code file. This will enable the program to read the contents of the file, process it for aesthetics and readability and post it on social media platforms like twitter/x and Telegram channels.

Nice.

Change made from github.
